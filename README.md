# Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, Run_analysis.R, contains the code for data preparation, and 5 steps to create a tidy dataset out of the UCI HAR Dataset.

# Steps
The steps of the Run_analysis.R are:
STEP 0: Download the data and assign the data frames
STEP 1: Merge the training and the test sets 
Step 2: Extract the measurements on the mean and sd
Step 3: Create descriptive activity names to name the activities
Step 4: Create appropriate labels with descriptive variable names
Step 5: Creating an independent dataset with the avarage of each variable of activity and subject

The end result is shown in the file PreparedData.txt

# Files
This repository contains, beside this README file, 3 other files:
1) CodeBook.md. describes the objects, the data, and the work that is performed to clean up the data.

2) Run_analysis.R contains all the code for preparing and creating the tidy dataset.

3) PreparedData.txt is the tidy dataset containing the tidy dataset.
